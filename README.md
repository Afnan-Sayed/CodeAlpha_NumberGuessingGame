# Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game repository! This project is part of my internship at CodeAlpha, where I developed a fun and interactive game using C++.

## About the Game
The Number Guessing Game is a classic guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it. The game offers multiple difficulty levels, including Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with a different range of numbers. Players can choose their preferred difficulty level and attempt to guess the correct number within the specified range.

## Features
### Multiple difficulty levels:
Choose between Easy (1-100), Medium (1-500), and Hard (1-1000) modes.
### Hint system: 
Players receive hints based on their performance, with additional hints unlocked as they progress.
### Input validation:
The game ensures that players enter valid numerical inputs and provides prompts for invalid inputs.
## How to Play
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the main.cpp file using your preferred C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a difficulty level and guess the number.
